## Authorship

* The main author of the dataset, Ruth-Ann Harris, seems to have compiled this dataset as her keystone/main project of her career and thus is pursuing the topic for historical purposes, with an intent focused on expanding the known Irish of the time. The project is laid out with a secondary intent of helping Digital Humanities student learn how to contribute to and build a database, as the project contains a codex for contribution as well as a google data entry form. Harris has not only helped compile this dataset but has also written up the dataset in book form in conjunction with other two other authors.

## Data Analysis

* Do the datasets involved reflect the viewpoints of particular groups or institutions, and if so, who?
* What kinds of categorizations do you find in the data, and do they seem reasonable?
* Do the means of data collection or categorization affect how the data is constructed in any way?
* Does the website contain any tools for visualizing the data? Do they seem like they are making any kind of arguments?
