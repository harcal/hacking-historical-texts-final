## Authorship

The main author of the dataset, Ruth-Ann Harris, seems to have compiled this dataset as her keystone/main project of her career and thus is pursuing the topic for historical purposes, with an intent focused on expanding the known Irish of the time. The project is laid out with a secondary intent of helping Digital Humanities student learn how to contribute to and build a database, as the project contains a codex for contribution as well as a google data entry form. Harris has not only helped compile this dataset but has also written up the dataset in book form in conjunction with other two other authors.
