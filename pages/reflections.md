After finishing the limited amount of research I had conducted on the project, I realize that the most important thing gained from this project was a better understanding of how to manipulate data. The overall experience of this project helped me develop a brand new skill of using github to psuedo code and create websites. While I may have done the project on my own, I still have an understanding of how efficient Github is at creating group projects and editing them in realtime. 

While shrinking the data set in size might have made it easier to clean and prepare the data, it would have caused bias and false research as a result. Finding a dataset that is more refined or smaller in size would have made preparation and analysis successful instead of a failure. The given dataset contains too many errors to be corrected in a short amount of time, which would not have worked for the project. The given data I chose needs much work in order to be easiable usable in programs such as Orange or Tableau. However, even though the data may not have been organized enough for intricate analysis, I was still able to draw some basic conclusions from what data was usable. Future usage of this data will first require heavy manual refinement by multiple people in order to make it more accurate.
