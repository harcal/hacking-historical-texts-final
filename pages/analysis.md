When it came to visualizing the data and drawing conclusions from what was there, I ran into quite a bit of trouble. Due to the formatting of the locations for the seekers and the lost, it was impossible for me to draw any conclusions or relations between those data identifiers. I instead attempted looking at profession and seeing if there was any correlation there, but was unable to get Tableau to generate any useful visualizations.

The visualizations displayed above were from Tableau, and were useless in providing any sort of distinguishable trends. The only information that Tableau yielded was that the majority of missing immigrants were men and that family members were the dominant seekers posting in the paper. Instead of providing a universal system for identifying the last location of each individual, straggler details are left attached on many of the locations. This wouldn't as big of an issue if the data set wasnt so large, but the data set contains nearly 42,00 entries, therefore making the task of cleaning it a long and arduous one. I ran into a situation similar to one described in the Hacking Historical Texts class, where a dataset contained a plethora of information but was too inconsistent at the time in identifying to be used effectively. 

At this point it was evident the data needed much refining in order to yield more intricate results. From what I had I could draw the conclusion that the majority of missing immgrants were males who worked a manual labor job, and that those were posting on their behalf in the paper were usually family members and not something else, such as a coworker or acquintance.
