With the introduction of the Great Potato Famine in Ireland in the mid to late 1840s came large increases in immigration rates. Most who fled Ireland in hopes of a new beginning and salvation traveled to the United States and Ireland. With the majority of those emigrating having no money and little financial stability, there was bound to be resulting chaos, increased poverty and violent racial discrimination. Many Irish, as well as other immigrants of different nationality of the time, were bound to encounter great obstacles on a new path to success, with the majority succumbing to poverty and poor living. Many immigrants would die in riots, gang rivalries and simple conflicts over resources. Since the technology and government of the time was limited in data collection and keeping track of civilians, many loved ones would often resort to buying adspace in newspapers to attempt and find missing loved ones or acquintances. 

YOU SHOULD BE LIBERAL AND INCLUDE ANY AND ALL LINKS WHEN RELEVANT

## Historical Background

This is where your historiography goes. You can discuss the historiography of specific times and places, but you can also discuss any theoretical literature you think is relevant.

You have freedom to roam from the narrow topic of your project to explore how different authors/schools of thought have impacted scholarly approaches over time. However, make sure that in the end you clearly relate how this discussion relates to the subject of your project and/or your choices in methods or interpreative models.

As you discuss different authors, you may site them using (author, page) style parenthetical notation. Make sure that a full citation in [Chicago](http://chicagomanualofstyle.org) is added to the 'docs/credits.md' page.

## Digital Background

You should also make sure to do research on any relevant digital work, whether scholarly articles or digital projects. Make sure to check Digital Humanities Quarterly, or [DHQ](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/), [Debates in the Digital Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/), [JStor](https://jstor.org), blogs and more to find relevant work.

You don't actually have to have a sepearte 'Digital Background' section. If it feels more natural to you, you may combine them into a single discussion. This is especially a good idea if you feel that with your topic you cannot talk about historiography without also talking about digital scholarship, and vice versa.
